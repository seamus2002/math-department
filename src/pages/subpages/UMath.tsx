                <h3>Mathematics Major</h3>
                <p>The mathematics major introduces students to the fundamental areas of mathematics and provides some degree of specialization in one or more areas.  It trains students in the analytic thinking characteristic of pure and applied mathematics and provides familiarity with rigorous methods of mathematical proof.</p>
                <p>In addition to the standard Mathematics Major, the department offers a number of specialized undergraduate tracks for students interested in pursuing careers in Bioinformatics or in preparing for teaching: the Quantitative Biology concentration, the Preparation for Adolescent Education (Grades 7-12) concentration, and the Preparation for Childhood Education (Grades 1-6) concentration.</p>
                <br />
                <br />

                <h4>Curriculum</h4>
                <p>To enter the standard Mathematics Major, the student should have completed the equivalent of one year of Calculus.  The major consists of at least 33 credits of coursework: 24 credits of core curriculum courses (taken by all majors except those enrolled in the concentration Preparation for Childhood Education: Grades 1-6) and at least 9 credits of advanced elective courses, chosen by students according to their career plans. Proficiency in symbolic computation is also required.</p>
                
                <h5>Major Core Curriculum</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>MATH 15600: Introduction to Mathematical Proof Workshop</li>

                <br />
            
                <h5>Elective Courses</h5>
                <p>The student must complete three 3-credit approved elective courses.  The elective courses must be chosen from the 300-or 400-level courses in mathematics or statistics listed by the department.  Factors affecting the choice of courses will include the student’s career goals (preparation for graduate study; education; careers in business, government service or industry), the student’s other major, where applicable, and the availability of courses due to the course rotation schedule.  A 300-level course may be replaced by a graduate level course approved by a departmental advisor.</p>
            
                <h5>Symbolic Computation Proficiency Requirement</h5>
                <p>As a requirement for graduation with a BA in Mathematics, students must demonstrate entry level proficiency in symbolic computation. The requirement can be met in any of the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>passing any of MATH 12600, MATH 15100, MATH 15400, MATH 38500</li>
                    <li>passing a departmental exam in a computer algebra system (currently we use MATHEMATICA or the equivalent)</li>
                </ul>

                <br />
                <br />

                <h4>Concentration in Quantitative Biology</h4>
                <p>This program is for students intending to pursue research careers in biomedical sciences.  It provides students with a working knowledge of computing and biological sciences for bioengineering careers in bioinformatics, the pharmaceutical industry, and the biotechnology industry.  For this concentration, the student must complete the entry requirement for the mathematics major (MATH 15000 and 15500 or equivalent), and the symbolic computation proficiency requirement for the Mathematics major, satisfied by STAT 31900 in this curriculum.
