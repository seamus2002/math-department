                <h3>Statistics Major</h3>
                <p>The study of statistics provides the student with analytical tools that may find application in various fields within the sciences and social sciences. Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing area open to students in statistics with a working knowledge of computing and biological sciences. Actuarial science is one area open to students in Statistics who also have backgrounds in such subjects as Computer Science, Mathematics and Economics.</p>

                <br />
                <br />

                <h4>Curriculum</h4>
                <p>To enter the Statistics Major the student must have completed MATH 150 and 155.  Normally, the statistics major consists of 33 credits as follows: 30 credits of core curriculum courses and any additional 3-credit statistics, mathematics, or computer science course approved by the statistics advisor.  Modifications are permitted with the consent of the statistics advisor.  For example, a student may elect to replace STAT 212 with a more advanced course.  With permission of the advisor, a student may take graduate courses in statistics and applied mathematics.</p>

                <h4>Concentration in Quantitative Biology</h4>
                <p>This program is for students intending to pursue research careers in biomedical sciences. It provides students with a working knowledge of computing and biological sciences for bioengineering careers in bioinformatics, the pharmaceutical industry, and the biotechnology industry. For this concentration, students must complete the entry requirement for the Statistics Major, MATH 15000 and MATH 15500, and the core curriculm for the statistics major. Instead of taking the additional 3 credit major elective course, bioinformatics concentrators take the additional courses listed below.</p>

                <h3>Statistics Minor</h3>
                <p><i>Note on Minors: As of March 2009, the selection of a minor is optional at Hunter College. The determination of courses required in a minor concentration is left to the minor departments or programs which choose to offer such sequences.</i></p>
                <br />
                <p>A minor in statistics consists of at least 12 credits selected from STAT courses offered by the department. Students should consult the catalog to determine prerequisites necessary for them to enroll in courses that count toward the minor.  It is recommended that prospective statistics minors consult with an undergraduate statistics advisor concerning course selection.</p>
