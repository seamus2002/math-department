            <h3>Logic Minor</h3>
            <p><i>Note on Minors: As of March 2009, the selection of a minor is optional at Hunter College. The determination of courses required in a minor concentration is left to the minor departments or programs which choose to offer such sequences.</i></p>
            <br />
            <p>The minor in logic consists of courses from three distinct disciplines that study logic: mathematics, computer science, and philosophy.  It introduces students to all three disciplinary perspectives on logic.  The following four cross-listed courses are required for this minor:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MATH 27500: Symbolic Logic (<i>combined with CSCI/PHILO 27500</i>)</li>
                <li>MATH 37000: Advanced Symbolic Logic (<i>combined with CSCI 37100/PHILO 37500</i>)</li>
                <li>MATH 37100: Logic and Computers (<i>combined with CSCI/PHILO 37200</i>)</li>
                <li>MATH 37700: Non-classical Logic (<i>combined with CSCI/PHILO 37700</i>)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
