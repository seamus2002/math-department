            <h3>BA/MA Program in Mathematics or in Statistics and Applied Mathematics</h3>
            <p>The BA/MA program offers promising students the opportunity to complete both the bachelor’s and master’s degree requirements with a minimum of 120 credits.  Requirements are the same as those for a major in the department, plus 30 credits at the graduate level.  Interested students should contact the graduate advisor for further information regarding eligibility and curriculum requirements.</p>
            
            <br />

            <h4>BA/MA Program in Mathematics</h4>
            <p>Students complete the BA with a standard Mathematics major, with 30 additional credits at the graduate level in Pure Mathematics approved by the departmental graduate advisor.</p>

            <br />

            <h4>BA/MA Program in Statistics and Applied Mathematics</h4>
            <p>Students complete the BA with a standard major in either Statistics or Mathematics, with 30 additional credits at the graduate level in Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, approved by the departmental graduate advisor.</p>

            <h3>BA/MA Program in Preperation for Adolecent Education</h3>
            <p>Students interested in secondary school teaching may pursue a combined BA/MA program in teaching.  This program requires a minimum of 141 credits.</p>

            <br />

            <h5>Admissions Requirements for the BA/MA in Teaching</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Completion of at least 45 credits with a GPA of at least 3.0</li>
                <li>Completion of at least 10 credits in Mathematics, including a year of calculus (MATH 15000 and 15500, or the equivalent), with a GPA of 2.7 or higher in these major courses</li>
                <li>Admission to the School of Education</li>
            </ul>

            <br />

            <h5>Degree Requirements for the BA/MA in Teaching</h5>
            <p>The BA/MA program in the Teaching of Mathematics includes 48 credits in Mathematics (in addition to the year of calculus described above) and 27 credits in teacher education courses, some of them taken at the undergraduate level and some at the graduate level. The required MATH/STAT courses are the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The courses required for the BA in Mathematics or Statistics</li>
                <li>MATH 62000: Secondary School Math from an Advanced Perspective I</li>
                <li>MATH 63000: Secondary School Math from an Advanced Perspective II</li>
                <li>MATH 63300: Axiomatic Geometry</li>
                <li>MATH 63500: Problem Solving Explorations in Mathematics</li>
                <li>STAT 61200: Discrete Probability, or STAT 61400: Data Analysis Using Statistical Software</li>
            </ul>

            <br />

            <p>Also required is passing a comprehensive examination in Mathematics consisting of three parts covering the material in MATH 62000, 63000, and 63300. Students may sit for the comprehensive examination only after having taken all three courses. Students who fail any part of the examination need only retake that part of the examination.  A student can take any part of the comprehensive exam in mathematics twice; after that, a committee formed by the Mathematics/Statistics Chairperson and consisting of members from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Department of Curriculum and Teaching will decide if the student can take the exam a third and final time.</p>
            <p>The student should consult the School of Education section of the graduate college catalog for the sequence of teacher education courses.</p>
